Bang Bang Controller is nothing but the on-off controller.

# To understand this Run the Bang-Bang_Sim.py or Bang-Bang_Sim.C (preferably python file because it also plots the values)

If the current value is below set point, the control action is to ON
If the current value is above set point, the control action is to OFF

If temp<50(set point) heater is ON and temperature is increased in steps of 5 degrees every cycle until it isn't less than 50(either equal to or greater than 50)
When temp is not <50, the heater is OFF and the temperature is reduced by 2 degrees every cycle because of ambience temperature of 20 degrees.

I Implemented the Bang-Bang Control for the Robot and made the it work as a line follower. The speeds can be altered. But now the objective is to implement the same using PID
Let's go step by step and first do the P Controller.
